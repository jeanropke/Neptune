                                Help Desk or interrupt a game halfway through. Double clicking on any hatch opens or

                                and pleasure... {{ cms_config('hotel.name.short') }} rollers for games and queues. Rollers come in five different
                                colours in the catalogue, while extra colours can occasionally be found in the
                                catalogue.<br>Rollers are great obstacles in games, (especially if you put a pet on
                                them!)- place them next to a valuable porter and watch the players fall over themselves!<br><br><strong>Stickies</strong><br><img

                                great for game rooms to leave instructions on how to play, or in group rooms where you
                                can use them to give new recruits instructions or hide it behind a piece of Furni as a
